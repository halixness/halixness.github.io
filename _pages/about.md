I study Artificial Intelligence Systems at the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Trento'>University of Trento</a>.<br> My research interests include generative models, multi-task/multi-modal learning and emergence. I believe (1) knowledge stems from interaction as well, (2) language is not sufficient, (3) machines shall have a human nature as base. I'm particularly keen on probability theory.

In this web space I share my research in a broad sense, that is the pursuit of understanding about life, society and intelligence (my main field of studies) artificially and naturally. I love blogs seeking for rationality and wisdom [[1](https://moretothat.com)][[2](https://www.lesswrong.com)], as well as learning about different ethnicities and cultures (big fan of National Geographic).
