I am a Research Intern in Deep RL + Biology at <a href='https://mila.quebec'>MILA Quebec AI Institute</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://pierrelucbacon.com'>Prof. Pierre-Luc Bacon</a> and <a href='https://proceduralia.github.io'>Pierluca D'Oro</a>. I am a graduate student in Artificial Intelligence Systems from the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Trento'>University of Trento</a>.<br> My research interests include deep learning reasoning, agency and intersections in applied sciences. I believe in (1) the gains from multi-modality, (2) logic can be structure in a conceptual space, (3) machines shall have a human nature as base. I'm particularly keen on probability theory.

In this web space I share my research in a broad sense, that is the pursuit of understanding about life, society and intelligence (my main field of studies) artificially and naturally. I love blogs seeking for rationality and wisdom [[1](https://moretothat.com)][[2](https://www.lesswrong.com)], as well as learning about different ethnicities and cultures (big fan of National Geographic).
