I am a Ph.D. student at <a href='https://mila.quebec'>Mila Quebec AI Institute</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://pierrelucbacon.com'>Prof. Pierre-Luc Bacon</a>. Currently, my research consists of Reinforcement Learning with Large Language Models for applications (drug discovery, material discovery) and theory (hierarchical teinforcement Learning, generative rewards). 

With my studies in CS/AI, I developed a background in software engineering, logic, computer vision and language. Deep research questions lie at the intersection: what priors are necessary and sufficient to develop intelligent behavior? How to learn efficiently? What are the benefits for humanity in scaling artificial intelligence?

In this web space I aim to share my research in the broader sense, that is the pursuit of understanding of life, intelligence and creativity. My interests are highly heterogenous, from <a href="https://jonathanhaidt.com/anxious-generation/">social psychology</a> to <a href="https://plasticfree.com/">environmental activism</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/westenberg/how-convenience-kills-curiosity-33a53ce69486">analog life</a>. In my spare time, I play music, enjoy board sports and read mostly about research in other fields.
