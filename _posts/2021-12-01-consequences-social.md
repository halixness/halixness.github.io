## Introduction
This article derives from an essay I wrote for my dream university. Beyond the academic purpose, this article is motivated by a deep interest in studying the dynamics of society and its most influential factors. You can check the references for each fact for further research, or to assess the validity of my statements, which reflect my vision on the topic.

The popularity of social media have steadily grown for the last 15 years: 2.71 billion people use a smartphone <d-cite key="art1"/>, which has become a standard means of communication for new generations. A survey shows that 95% of US teenagers<d-cite key="art2"/> aged 13–18 have access to it, 45% of them almost constantly<d-cite key="art2"/>. Social media are taking a significant part in our lives: they affect social relationships, political views, they are believed to influence behavior and thus they are used in marketing. This article will provide an overview of recent findings about the effects of social media on human society.

A common question in research is whether the time spent online is increasingly replacing face-to-face interactions (social displacement <d-cite key="art1"/><d-cite key="art4"/>). Yet not enough evidence supports this theory, since social relationships take place in mixed modalities that are difficult to analyze. A study from Twenge<d-cite key="art5"/> suggests that less time is now spent in in-person activities compared to thirty years ago. However, on an individual level more time on social media are associated with more face-to-face interaction; when the latter is missing, heightened sense of loneliness and anxiety may occur<d-cite key="art3"/>.

## Mental Health

Do social media affect mental health? The main users for social media are teenagers <d-cite key="art1"/><d-cite key="art3"/>, who present a heightened sensibility for social information; a higher risk for mental illness is present during adolescence: nearly 1 in 5 adolescents suffer from mental disorders<d-cite key="art7"/>. With younger teenagers being the most active users online<d-cite key="art3"/>, they find in social media an opportunity to explore their identity (self-disclosure) and gain social approval (peer evaluation) in quantifiable forms such as “likes”, “comments” and “views”<d-cite key="art8"/>. However, the vision of reality perceived on social media is overly-positive, since users choose what to show (false-self-presentation<d-cite key="art3"/>) to their peers; research suggests a link between social media use and low self esteem or anxiety for sensible subjects<d-cite key="art4"/>. 

A common habit in using these platforms is cause for “digital stress”, which is explained by Jeffrey Hall<d-cite key="art9"/> in four elements: fear of missing out (FoMO), communication overload (too many notifications), constant availability-stress and approval anxiety (based on likes and comments). Moreover, frequent online activity, encouraged by notifications and messages, is found to negatively affect sleep schedule (crucial for development) and attention during critical activities (such as driving)<d-cite key="art4"/>. Additional concerns are raised on the exposure of sensible subjects, such as teenagers, to religious-hate, sexist, homophobic and violent contents, with current research studying the links with behavioral tendencies<d-cite key="art3"/>.

Recent literature in psychology coined the terms “Internet Use Disorder” (UID)<d-cite key="art10"/> and “Smartphone Use Disorder” (SUD) <d-cite key="art1"/>. In their paper <d-cite key="art1"/>, Montag et al. defined mechanisms built in social media applications to drive the user’s behavior: “read receipts” in instant messaging apps trigger social pressure and the urge to provide a fast reply<d-cite key="art11"/>; endless scroll in newsfeeds and auto-play keep the user hooked with drastically decreased attention to external stimuli and distorted sense of time<d-cite key="art12"/><d-cite key="art13"/><d-cite key="art14"/>; screen time and online activity are tracked to infer the user’s interests and thus display ad-hoc advertisements<d-cite key="art15"/>. Ethical concerns have been raised on the use of such sensible data to maximise profit with targeted marketing. With the Cambridge Analytica scandal<d-cite key="art16"/>, new legislation aims to regulate the storing of personal information, their permanency and the rights to use them<d-cite key="art17"/>.

## Self development

On the other hand, social media provide their users with a space that favors self-development<d-cite key="art3"/><d-cite key="art6"/>: teenagers can freely explore and express their identity, they find more emotional and social support online from other peers or entire communities<d-cite key="art18"/>, eventually they can establish long-term relationships without the bound of distance. Moreover, social networking sites provide a tangible space for research and prevention: on a large scale, sophisticated machine learning algorithms are trained to detect signals of mental illness: depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicidality<d-cite key="art19"/>; Facebook and Instagram have already implemented such algorithms to detect users exhibiting signs of emotional distress or suicide risk, further research is needed to assess their efficacy.

## Political views

Beyond the effects on individual subjects, social media are studied when influencing political views. “Echo chambers”<d-cite key="art20"/> originated online: subjects with affine ideals create closed groups by unfriending and blocking other users who present different political views. The effects of echo chambers are still actively discussed<d-cite key="art21"/><d-cite key="art22"/>, but concerns raise on individuals in the fringes, who are more prone to polarize in extreme political positions<d-cite key="art21"/><d-cite key="art23"/>. A consequent question is: would exposure to diverse information decrease the marginalization of such groups? According to O’Hara<d-cite key="art23"/> and Sumpter<d-cite key="art24"/>, such users tend to confront contrasting ideas to reinforce their original beliefs (“opinion seekers”, Dubois, 2020<d-cite key="art21"/>) and seem less likely to change their opinion: a 2016 Pew Survey<d-cite key="art24"/> showed that more than 79% of individuals have never changed their political views after reading about contrasting ideas. Such groups may represent a potential risk in a political setting, recent facts from the US State Capitol Riot<d-cite key="art27"/> foster questions on their influence on neutral voters via social media.
Within this context, it is crucial to consider the effects of social media on information consumption. A recent article from the Reuters Institute in Oxford<d-cite key="art26"/> reports that online users consume more news than “offline” ones, even when they are not looking for it. This occurs when machine learning algorithms generate newsfeeds on social networks: they choose what contents best represent the user’s interests before they look for it (“pre-selected personalization”)<d-cite key="art31"/>. “Filter bubbles”<d-cite key="art22"/><d-cite key="art27"/> define a unique universe of information tailored for every user to keep their engagement high online at the expense of information diversity and freedom of choice. Conversely, Fletcher<d-cite key="art20"/><d-cite key="art26"/><d-cite key="art31"/> reports that information sparsity online encourages the creation of more impartial, “partisan” content for marginalised groups. Further research is necessary to assess the implications of using such filtering algorithms, it is certain that these technologies are difficult to analyze given their rapid pace of change.

## Benefits

It is noteworthy to mention several circumstances where social media provides a substantial benefit. In the work environment<d-cite key="art29"/>, the use of social media creates cohesion between coworkers, it boosts networking and it encourages knowledge sharing, which translates into work performance and competitive advantage. Moreover, an actively social behavior online <d-cite key="art1"/><d-cite key="art29"/> is not linked to SUD: posting contents and engaging in active conversations reflects the human urge for social bonding, which translates as also outlined in the Pankseppian Affective Neuroscience Theory<d-cite key="art32"/>.

The impact of social media on human society is concrete and yet difficult to understand. At an early stage, current research shows its duality: while it provides a powerful tool for expanding communication globally, it can be exploited to enhance polarization, it leads to negative social comparison and it can be used for unethical marketing. Engineers can’t fully hold responsibility for this: increasing awareness<d-cite key="art16"/> is leading to the intervention of political institutions<d-cite key="art17"/> to regulate social media, whose effects on society are beyond the expected.
